# Hackatheme for Hugo

> A multilingual theme for time-bounded co-creation events such as hackathons, with a meta twist.

**Hackatheme** is a Hugo theme designed to ease the organization of a hackathon and similar time-bounded events and publish it online.

It includes lots of open source delights, a sprinkle of stardust and plenty of chocolate chips üç™.

It is also a **meta-project** in the sense that it includes documentation on how to replicate itself.
