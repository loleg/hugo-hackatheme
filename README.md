# Hackatheme for Hugo

## Installation

Go to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run:

    $ mkdir themes
    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/open-network-infrastructure/hugo-hackatheme

For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Configuration

After installing the **Hackatheme** theme successfully, we recommend you to take a look at the [exampleSite](https://github.com/open-network-infrastructure/hugo-hackatheme/tree/master/exampleSite) directory. You will find a working Hugo site configured with this theme that you can use as a starting point for your site.

First, let's take a look at the [config.toml](https://github.com/open-network-infrastructure/hugo-hackatheme/tree/master/exampleSite/config.toml). It will be useful to learn how to customize your site. Feel free to play around with the settings.

### Language

You can configure the language modifying the following key.

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
```

Available translations are in the `/i18n` directory.

### Google Analytics

You can optionally enable Google Analytics if you add your tracking code in the configuration.

```toml
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXX-X"
```
